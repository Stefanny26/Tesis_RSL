2024, 4 1435
ing data durability and preventing data loss through a clocking mechanism known
as heartbeat.
• MapReduce [13]: MapReduce in MongoDB is a flexible but complex feature. It processes
large datasets in parallel across multiple nodes, enabling complex data analytical
tasks, statistical analysis, and report generation. It is utilized for the batch processing
of extensive datasets, providing flexibility and power in data processing.
• GridFS [14,15]: MongoDB’s GridFS allows storage and retrieval of large files of the
size 16 MB or more, like images, videos, and audio files, by breaking them into
smaller chunks distributed across multiple nodes. This efficient storage and retrieval
mechanism is beneficial for applications requiring the handling of large multimedia
files or content management systems.
• Automatic Sharding [16]: MongoDB’s sharding feature distributes data across multiple
servers to enhance database performance by balancing the load. Automatic
sharding distributes data based on specified shard keys, with MongoDB’s balancer ensuring
even distribution across shards, thereby optimizing database performance [14].
MongoDB includes ranged sharding, hashed sharding, and zoned sharding.
• Security [17]: MongoDB’s security features include authentication, authorization,
encryption, and network security. It supports various authentication mechanisms and
encryption at rest, injection prevention [18], as well as TLS/SSL for secure connections.
MongoDB also provides a security checklist for protecting deployments and a process
for reporting security bugs [19].

components, MongoDB’s architecture encompasses other components like drivers and
storage engines. MongoDB’s features enable developers to build flexible, scalable, and
high-performance applications capable of handling large volumes of data efficiently using
tools like the document-oriented data model, horizontal scalability, indexing, aggregation,
replication, MapReduce, sharding, and GridFS. These features cater to the requirements of
modern businesses, ensuring robust and efficient application development [19].
2.3. Comparing MongoDB with SQL Databases
Table 1 compares MongoDB and document-based SQL databases [6,20]. MongoDB and
SQL databases diverge notably in their data models and scalability options. MongoDB’s
document-oriented approach facilitates the flexible storage of unstructured data, with
documents akin to rows in SQL databases but offering nested fields, favoring complex
data structures and aggregation. On the other hand, SQL databases adhere to a rigid
table-based schema, enabling efficient joins across tables and precise control over data
consistency [20,21]. While MongoDB excels in horizontal scalability through sharding, SQL
databases typically offer vertical scalability, ensuring robust transactional capabilities but
potentially limiting scalability for massive datasets [22].
Table 1. Comparing MongoDB vs. SQL databases.
MongoDB SQL Databases
Collection Table
Document Row
Field Column
Aggregation Joins
In SQL databases, a primary key is a field or combination of fields that uniquely
identifies each record in a table [6,20]. A primary key serves two crucial functions: ensuring
uniqueness and maintaining referential integrity. It uniquely identifies each record in a
table, preventing duplicate entries, and acts as a reference point for foreign keys in related
tables, facilitating the establishment of relationships between them [20]. In MongoDB, the
equivalent of a primary key is the _id field [23] for each document (row in SQL) in the
collection (table in SQL). The _id field in MongoDB, which is immutable and generated
automatically, guarantees that each document is unique and constant. If an ObjectId is not
specifically given, MongoDB will assign one to ensure this uniqueness.
While both SQL and MongoDB employ unique identifiers, they diverge in several
aspects. In SQL, the primary key can be any chosen field [20], while MongoDB mandates
_id as the unique identifier. SQL’s primary key can be altered, albeit not recommended,
whereas MongoDB’s _id remains immutable. Additionally, MongoDB auto-generates a
Encyclopedia 2024, 4 1438
unique _id if absent, whereas, in SQL, the primary key must be set manually or through
auto-increment mechanisms [6,21].
2.4. Comparing MongoDB with Other NoSQL Databases
Other popular NoSQL databases besides MongoDB include Apache Cassandra [24],
Redis [25], Apache CouchDB [26], Apache Hbase [27], and Amazon DynamoDB [28].
MongoDB’s simplicity in data representation and querying can reduce development time
and complexity compared to databases like Cassandra [24] and Hbase [27], which may
require more effort to manage and query data. Databases like Redis and CouchDB offer
scalability features, and MongoDB’s sharding capabilities are particularly robust and wellsuited
for high-volume applications. While Redis offers excellent performance for specific
use cases like caching, MongoDB’s versatility and ability to handle complex data structures
contribute to its overall performance superiority [29].
In the NoSQL databases category, MongoDB reportedly leads with an estimated
market share of approximately 44.29% [30]. Following MongoDB, DynamoDB holds a
share of 10.17%, while Cassandra and HBase hold 5.16% and 4.06%, respectively. Amazon
ElastiCache rounds out the list with a share of 2.32% [2].
MongoDB introduced multi-document transactions in version 4.0, allowing developers
to perform atomic operations across multiple documents within a single transaction. This
feature enhances data consistency and integrity, making MongoDB more suitable for
transactional applications compared to databases like Redis and Cassandra, which may
have limitations in this area.
While each NoSQL database has its strengths and uses cases, MongoDB’s combination
of ease of use, scalability, performance, transaction support, and ecosystem make it a
compelling choice for a wide range of applications and industries.
MongoDB’s native sharding capability allows seamless scaling across multiple nodes
to handle write-intensive workloads and growing data sizes without adding complexity
to applications. Sharding enables the easy adjustment of shards and shard keys, ensuring
system availability while automatically rebalancing data across the shards as needed.
Unlike other distributed databases that randomly distribute data, MongoDB offers multiple
sharding policies tailored to specific query patterns or data placement needs, including
ranged, hashed, and zoned sharding [19].
Additionally, MongoDB offers tiered scaling through the MongoDB Atlas Online
Archive, enabling economical storage scaling by automatically moving aged data to lowercost
storage tiers while maintaining accessibility through federated queries [19].

3. Advantages
MongoDB offers several advantages, which include the following:
• Flexible Schema and Ease of Use: MongoDB’s document-oriented data model allows
for flexible schemas, enabling developers to store data without a predefined structure.
This flexibility accommodates evolving data requirements and simplifies database
management [14].
• Scalability: MongoDB supports horizontal scalability through sharding, distributing
data across multiple nodes to handle large volumes of data and high traffic loads
efficiently. This scalability ensures that MongoDB can grow with the needs of an
application [8].
• High Performance: MongoDB’s indexing, aggregation, and query optimization capabilities
contribute to high performance, enabling fast data retrieval and processing.
Additionally, MongoDB’s in-memory storage engine, WiredTiger [37], further enhances
performance for read-heavy workloads.
• Rich Query Language: MongoDB’s query language (MQL) [38] offers powerful features
for querying and manipulating data, including support for complex queries,
aggregation pipelines, geospatial queries, and text search through their MongoDB
shell (Mongosh) [39] platform. This allows developers to express a wide range of data
access patterns.
• Replication and High Availability: MongoDB supports automatic data replication
across multiple nodes, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance. In the event
of node failure, MongoDB can automatically promote a secondary node to primary
status, minimizing downtime and data loss [14].
• Document-Level Transactions: MongoDB introduced multi-document transactions,
allowing developers to perform atomic operations across multiple documents within
a single transaction. This ensures data consistency and integrity, especially in transactional
applications [14].
• Rich Ecosystem and Community: MongoDB offers a comprehensive ecosystem of
tools, libraries, and services to support development, deployment, and management
tasks. The MongoDB community [40] is active and vibrant, providing resources,
documentation, and support to developers worldwide.
• Real-Time Analytics: MongoDB’s real-time analytical [41] capabilities provide organizations
with immediate insights by processing data as it is generated, enabling
agile decision-making. It seamlessly integrates diverse data sources and facilitates
streamlined data collection, ensuring relevant information is captured promptly. MongoDB’s
agile data convergence eliminates the need for slow ETL processes, allowing
for swift analysis of combined data streams. The platform’s seamless integration of
transactional and historical data enhances the completeness and accuracy of real-time
analysis while keeping costs low. With in-place analysis and a multitude of use cases
spanning personalization, fraud prevention, process optimization, and preemptive
maintenance, MongoDB empowers businesses to derive actionable insights swiftly
and efficiently, driving success in dynamic environments [42].
Overall, MongoDB’s advantages make it a popular choice for building modern, scalable,
and flexible applications across various industries and use cases.
4. Limitations
While MongoDB offers many advantages, it also has some limitations:
• Memory Consumption: MongoDB’s memory usage can be relatively high, especially
when handling large datasets or complex queries. This can lead to increased hardware
requirements and costs for memory-intensive workloads [14].
• Transaction Support: Transactional support in MongoDB refers to the ability of the
database system to maintain the atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID)
properties for operations that involve multiple documents or collections and enable
Encyclopedia 2024, 4 1441
MongoDB to ensure that a series of operations either all succeed, or all fail, preserving
data integrity, even in the face of concurrent access and failures. Although MongoDB
introduced multi-document transactions in version 4.0, transactions are not supported
across distributed shards in a sharded cluster. This limitation sometimes impacts the
consistency and integrity of data in distributed environments [14]. Before MongoDB
4.0, the database did not support multi-document ACID transactions [43], which are
critical for complex operations that need strong consistency. MongoDB 4.0+ supports
multi-document transactions, but these transactions come with a performance overhead,
especially compared to the relational databases that handle transactions more
efficiently and are designed around them. The MongoDB 7.0 version does not yet
handle transactions as robustly as the traditional relational databases. MongoDB may
fall short if applications require strong ACID compliance [43] and complex transaction
handling [44,45].
• Data Size Limitations: MongoDB has a document size limit of 16 MB, which may
restrict the storage of large documents or datasets. While this limit can be circumvented
by using GridFS [15] for storing large files, it adds complexity to data management.
• Schema Design Complexity [46]: While MongoDB’s flexible schema can be advantageous,
it also requires a careful schema design to ensure efficient query performance
and data integrity. Poorly designed schemas can lead to performance issues or data
inconsistency. In contrast, the schema design complexity in SQL databases is often
characterized by a rigid structure, normalization requirements, and management of
complex relationships and constraints.
• Join Operations: MongoDB’s document-oriented data model does not support the
traditional SQL-style joins between collections. While MongoDB provides mechanisms
such as embedded documents and denormalization to address this limitation, complex
join operations may be challenging to perform efficiently.
• Indexing Overhead/Unique Indexes: Creating indexes in MongoDB incurs overhead
in terms of storage space and write performance. Maintaining indexes for frequently
queried fields is essential for efficient query execution but requires careful consideration
to balance performance and storage requirements [47].
• Maturity of Ecosystem: While MongoDB’s ecosystem is comprehensive, some components
may not be as mature or feature-rich as those of traditional relational databases.
For example, tools for analytics, reporting, and data integrations are less developed
compared to SQL-based solutions.
• Concurrency and locking [46]: MongoDB employs a global write lock at the database
level, which can impact write scalability in high-concurrency environments. While
MongoDB offers fine-grained locking at the collection level for read operations, writeheavy
workloads may experience contention and performance bottlenecks.
• Buit-in Reporting: MongoDB lacks advanced, built-in reporting tools like some relational
databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) or specialized databases like Oracle,
which offer built-in reporting and analytics capabilities. External tools (e.g., BI tools
like Tableau [48] or MongoDB aggregation queries [11]) are required to generate reports,
which adds complexity. MongoDB does not offer the same level of built-in
reporting features found in relational databases like MySQL. Reporting tools must
be integrated into MongoDB Atlas via third-party solutions like a Microsoft-certified
Power BI connector and a Tableau connector [45,48].
• SQL Query Support: MongoDB does not support SQL natively [49]. It has its own
proprietary query language, MongoDB Query Language (MQL) [38], instead of SQL,
which is more flexible for certain NoSQL use cases but lacks the comprehensive
features of SQL, especially for complex querying, joins, and subqueries. This limitation
has been overcome by using the MongoDB Atlas SQL interface [50], which uses SQLstyle
queries that again do not support write operations [44].
• Data Duplication Problem: In MongoDB, data duplication (or denormalization [51]) is
a common design pattern to optimize performance and avoid expensive joins. This,
Encyclopedia 2024, 4 1442
however, can lead to data redundancy and potential consistency issues, as multiple
copies of the same data might need to be updated simultaneously. This is unlike
relational databases, which uses normalization to eliminate duplication and enforce
referential integrity with foreign keys. MongoDB’s flexible schema design often leads
to data duplication, especially in denormalized database models, which can result in
storage inefficiencies and challenges with data consistency [44,49].
Despite these limitations, MongoDB remains a popular choice for many applications
due to its flexibility, scalability, and rich feature set. However, it is essential for developers
and architects to carefully evaluate these limitations in the context of their specific use cases
and requirements.
5. CRUD Operations in MongoDB
5.1. Create a Database and Collection
Figure 1 demonstrates the creation of a database called “StudentRecords” and a
collection called “student” under that database in MongoDB using the Mongosh shell. The
“use” command switches the database to “StudentRecords” if it already exists; otherwise,
MongoDB will create it before making the switch. Upon successful execution, Mongosh
responds with “ok”.

is a common design pattern to optimize performance and avoid expensive joins. This,
however, can lead to data redundancy and potential consistency issues, as multiple
copies of the same data might need to be updated simultaneously. This is unlike relational
databases, which uses normalization to eliminate duplication and enforce
referential integrity with foreign keys. MongoDB’s flexible schema design often leads
to data duplication, especially in denormalized database models, which can result in
storage inefficiencies and challenges with data consistency [44,49].
Despite these limitations, MongoDB remains a popular choice for many applications
due to its flexibility, scalability, and rich feature set. However, it is essential for developers
and architects to carefully evaluate these limitations in the context of their specific use
cases and requirements.
5. CRUD Operations in MongoDB
5.1. Create a Database and Collection
Figure 1 demonstrates the creation of a database called “StudentRecords” and a collection
called “student” under that database in MongoDB using the Mongosh shell. The
“use” command switches the database to “StudentRecords” if it already exists; otherwise,
MongoDB will create it before making the switch. Upon successful execution, Mongosh
responds with “ok”.
Figure 1. Creating a database and collection in MongoDB using Mongosh shell.
5.2. Insert Documents into the Collection
Figure 2 illustrates the process of creating documents in MongoDB. The method “insertOne()”
is employed in MongoDB for inserting a singular document into a collection,
while “insertMany()” enables the insertion of multiple documents simultaneously.
The student documents inserted into the “student” collection comprise various fields,
each serving to encapsulate specific information about the students. The “name” field represents
an object encompassing details regarding the student’s name, including “first-
Name”, “middleName”, and “lastName”, all of which are of the string data type. The
“college” field, also of the string data type, denotes the name of the college the student
attends. Additionally, the “dateOfBirth” field, another string data type, signifies the student’s
date of birth. The “sports” field is an array of objects, with each object containing
information about a sport the student participates in. Within each object, there are “sport”,
“location”, and “teamName” fields, all which are of the string data type. Lastly, the
“courses” field represents an array of objects, with each object detailing a course in which
the student is enrolled. Each course object contains “courseName” and “courseNumber”
fields of the string data type, along with a “creditHrs” field of the number data type, representing
the credit hours associated with the course, ranging from 0 to 4.

6. Structure of MongoDB
The structure of MongoDB is based on a document-oriented model, which means that
data are stored in the form of documents rather than tables, as in traditional relational
databases. Each document is a JSON-like object composed of field-value pairs. These
documents are then organized within collections, which are akin to tables in relational
databases but with more flexibility.
One of the key features of MongoDB is its support for embedded documents and arrays
within these documents. Embedded documents allow for the nesting of one document
within another, which is useful for representing hierarchical data structures. Arrays, on
the other hand, enable the storage of multiple values within a single field, providing a
convenient way to handle lists or sets of related data.
The guidelines mentioned in [52] offer a comprehensive approach to the schema design
in MongoDB, focusing on efficient data access and the effective modeling of relationships.
Firstly, they advocate for grouping data that are frequently accessed together within the
same document, aiming to enhance query performance. Secondly, for one-to-one relationships,
the recommendation is to embed related data within a single document, streamlining
queries and ensuring data coherence. Similarly, for one-to-few relationships, embedding the
related data within the parent document is advised to improve data locality and reduce the
need for complex joins. For one-to-many and many-to-many relationships, the guidelines
Encyclopedia 2024, 4 1447
suggest using child references, which promotes data consistency and facilitates efficient
updates. Lastly, for unbounded one-to-many relationships, utilizing parent references is
recommended, enabling efficient querying while avoiding document size limitations.
Overall, these guidelines aim to optimize data access, ensure data consistency, and
simplify the querying processes by harnessing MongoDB’s document-oriented schema
design capabilities [52]. This structure offers several advantages. It allows for schema
flexibility, as documents within a collection can have different structures, making it easy to
adapt to changing data requirements. Moreover, the document-oriented model aligns well
with the way developers think about data, as objects in their programming languages often
map directly to documents in MongoDB.
